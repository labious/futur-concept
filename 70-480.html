                So, how do we get there? Begin at the beginning.
                <br><br>
                First, identify what the three key stakeholders (students, teachers and the board of directors) want. Students want affordable access to best-in-class teachers (not just celebrities who are teaching for the first time), to learn at their own pace and have sought after skills for an information and creative economy. Teachers want the best, most engaged students, who are committed to learning. They want relevancy and influence, to preserve their knowledge, make lasting impact and be rewarded for <br> their contributions. Lastly, the board of directors want to make a difference in the <br>world, look after the public good, increase diversity in students and teachers, and be<br> a champion for education.
                <br><br>
                Next, find alternative solutions. Leverage media platforms, social networks, and distance based learning tools.
                <br><br>
                Eliminate the biggest barriers to education: cost, time, and accessibility. Gather the most creative minds, technologists, producers and inspirational professionals to teach 21st century skills including: design thinking, problem solving, entrepreneurship, experience design, communication, media, content marketing and design. Make it affordable. Make it scalable. Make it equitable.

                That sounds modern, disruptive, and unlike any school out there. That’s because we believe the future of school isn't a school at all—classrooms have no walls, students are never late, and classes are always in session. Welcome to the school of tommorow.
